# Overview
Front-end React application powered by a back-end Node and Express server.<br>
Demo application is deployed to Netlify at [https://intercom.netlify.com/](https://intercom.netlify.com/).

## Introduction
Using your phone and headphones, you will have the ability to create voice chatrooms groups, talk directly into your groupâ€™s ears, and hear others talk into your ears. You can manage the group, see who is in the group and start up a voice call.

## Mission Statement
Our mission is to assist a wide variety of users ranging from those who may be hearing impaired or elderly to anyone who finds themselves as a group having difficulty conversing with others with overbearing background noise. We provide our users to opportunity to easily create and join personal groups and initiate voice chats within those groups to keep a clear communication link with their family and friends. Don't lose your voice, find your Voice Chatroom!
